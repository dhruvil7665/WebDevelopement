    <h2 align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:0;">EVIDENCE DOCUMENTS</h2>
    <p style="margin-left:20px;margin-top: 2px; font-size: large;">The following lists are examples of the types of documents you must provide with your application and are not all inclusive. Call us at 1-800-772-1213 if you cannot provide these documents.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; "><b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you are completing this application on behalf of someone else, you must provide evidence that shows your authority to sign the application as well as documents to prove your identity and the identity of the person for whom you are filing the application. We can only accept original documents or documents certified by the custodian of the original record. Notarized copies or photocopies which have not been certified by the custodian of the record are not acceptable</p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">Evidence of Age</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0;">In general, you must provide your birth certificate. In some situations, we may accept another document that shows your age. Some of the other documents we may accept are:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li style="font-size: large; margin-left: 0px;">Apply for an original Social Security card</li>
        <li style="font-size: large;">Apply for a replacement Social Security card</li>
        <li style="font-size: large;">Change or correct information on your Social Security number record</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 1px;">Evidence of Identity</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom:0px;">You must provide current, unexpired evidence of identity in your legal name. Your legal name will be shown on
        the Social Security card. Generally, we prefer to see documents issued in the U.S. Documents you submit to establish identity must show your legal name AND provide biographical information (your date of birth, age, or parents' names)<b>and/or</b>physical information (photograph, or physical description - height, eye and hair color, etc.). If you send a photo identity document but do not appear in person, the document must show your biographical information (e.g., your date of birth, age, or parents' names). Generally, documents without an expiration date should have been issued within the past two years for adults and within the past four years for children.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As proof of your identity, you must provide a:</p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
        <li style="font-size: large; margin-left: 0px;">U.S. driver's license; or</li>
        <li style="font-size: large;">U.S. State-issued non-driver identity card; or</li>
        <li style="font-size: large;">U.S. passport</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-right: 20px;">If you do not have one of the documents above or cannot get a replacement within 10 work days, we may accept other documents that show your legal name and biographical information, such as a U.S. military identity card, Certificate of Naturalization, employee identity card, certified copy of medical record (clinic, doctor or hospital), health insurance card, Medicaid card, or school identity card/record. For young children, we may accept medical records (clinic, doctor, or hospital) maintained by the medical provider. We may also accept a final adoption decree, or a school identity card, or other school record maintained by the school.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; ">If you are not a U.S. citizen, we must see your current U.S. immigration document(s) and your foreign passport with biographical information or photograph.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; ">WE CANNOT ACCEPT A BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HOSPITAL SOUVENIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE, SOCIAL
        SECURITY CARD STUB OR A SOCIAL SECURITY RECORD as evidence of identity.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 1px;">Evidence of U.S. Citizenship</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 0px;">In general, you must provide your U.S. birth certificate or U.S. Passport. Other documents you may provide are a Consular Report of Birth, Certificate of Citizenship, or Certificate of Naturalization.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 10px;">Evidence of Immigration Status</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 1px;">You must provide a current unexpired document issued to you by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
        showing your immigration status, such as Form I-551, I-94, or I-766. If you are an international student or exchange visitor, you may need to provide additional documents, such as Form I-20, DS-2019, or a letter authorizing employment from your school and employer (F-1) or sponsor (J-1). We CANNOT accept a receipt showing you applied for the document. If you are not authorized to work in the U.S., we can issue you a Social Security card only if you need the number for a valid non-work reason. Your card will be marked to show you cannot work and if you do work, we will notify DHS. See page 3, item 5 for more information.
