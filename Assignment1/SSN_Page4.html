    <p style="margin-left:20px; font-size: large; margin-top: 0px;">Protect your SSN card and number from loss and identity theft. DO NOT carry your SSN card with you. Keep it in a secure location and only take it with you when you must show the card; e.g., to obtain a new job, open a new bank account, or to obtain benefits from certain U.S. agencies. Use caution in giving out your Social Security number to others, particularly during phone, mail, email and Internet requests you did not initiate.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; ">The information you furnish on this form is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested information may prevent us from issuing you a Social Security number and card.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; ">We rarely use the information you supply for any purpose other than for issuing a Social Security number and card. However, we may use it for the administration and integrity of Social Security programs. We may also disclose information to another person or to another agency in accordance with approved routine uses, which include but are not limited to the following:</p>

            <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
            <li style="font-size: large;">To enable a third party or an agency to assist Social Security in establishing rights to Social Security benefits and/or coverage</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">To comply with Federal laws requiring the release of information from Social Security records (e.g., to the Government Accountability Office and Department of Veterans' Affairs);</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">To make determinations for eligibility in similar health and income maintenance programs at the Federal, State, and local level; and</li>
            <li style="font-size: large;">To facilitate statistical research, audit or investigative activities necessary to assure the integrity of Social Security programs.</li>

     <p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: large; margin-bottom: 0px;">We may also use the information you provide in computer matching programs. Matching programs compare our records with records kept by other Federal, State, or local government agencies.
        Information from these matching programs can be used to establish or verify a person's eligibility for Federally-funded or administered benefit programs and for repayment of payments or delinquent debts under these programs.
